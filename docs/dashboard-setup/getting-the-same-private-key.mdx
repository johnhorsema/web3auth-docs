## Private keys across Web3Auth products depend on the following factors

### Verifier

A verifier is a piece of information about the OAuth provider being used by the application, which is queried by web3auth auth network nodes from a
smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to verify the JWT token. To know more about creating verifiers, please refer
[here](/docs/auth-provider-setup/verifiers).

As the verifiers change, the private key changes. And as we go across different SDKs, we need different verifiers to be created, hence changing the
wallet addresses for the end-users.

### Aggregate Verifier

Aggregate verifier is combining multiple login methods to create a verifier to get the same wallet address for your user for the same email id
regardless of their login providers, for example, combining a Google and Email Passwordless login or Google and GitHub via Auth0 to access the same
key for your user. Refer to the docs [here](/docs/auth-provider-setup/verifiers/aggregate-verifier) to know more about creating an aggregate verifier.

Here, multiple sub-verifiers are combined under one single aggregate verifier, and one wallet address is generated from the aggregate verifier. This
is particularly useful when you want to have the same wallet address for your user across multiple verifiers created for different socials logged in
with the same email id.

### Client ID

To get your Client ID, it's as simple as setting up a new Plug and Play project on the Web3Auth dashboard. Now, "Plug and Play" might sound technical,
but it's just a way of describing the pre-packaged user interface and experience that Web3Auth has ready for you. The idea here is to make integrating
Web3Auth into your project as easy and efficient as possible, saving you the hassle of building everything from scratch. To get a client id for your
project, please refer [here](/docs/auth-provider-setup/client-id).

Wallet addresses depend on client ID only for plug and play SDKs because we take sub key from the main key in PNP SDKs.

### Environment

While creating a verifier you need to select between `testnet`, `mainnet`, `aqua`, and `cyan`.

`testnet` is a sandbox environment for developers to experiment. People usually test and finish their integration here. `mainnet`, `aqua` , & `cyan`
are the production environments for scalable applications.

When you test your application on `testnet` and then decide to move to one of the production envirionments, you will get a different wallet address
than the one you get on `mainnet`, `aqua`, or `cyan` as the nodes are different for each environment.

## General Tips

- PnP and Core-Kit SDKs have different keys, because we take subkey from the mainkey in PNP SDKs. Please check the `@toruslabs/openlogin-subkey`
  package for more details.
- In PnP SDKs, there is a parameter `useCoreKitKey` accepting boolean value which can be set to `true` to use the same wallet address as Core-Kit
  SDKs. Please check the following code snippet where `useCoreKitKey` is set to `true` while initializing the web-no-modal SDK:

```js
const web3auth = new Web3AuthNoModal({
  clientId,
  chainConfig,
  web3AuthNetwork: "cyan",
  useCoreKitKey: true,
});
```

- In core-kit SDKs, there is a parameter `usePnPKey` accepting boolean value which can be set to `true` to use the same wallet address as PnP SDKs.
  Please check the following code snippet where `usePnPKey` is set to `true` while initializing the web3auth-sfa SDK:

```js
const web3authSfa = new Web3AuthSFA({
  clientId,
  web3AuthNetwork: "cyan",
  usePnPKey: true,
});
```
- For MPC, the keys are totally different due to the different nodes.
