# Backup Share for Applications - dApp Share

## Web3Auth Infrastructure at a glance

If you go through the [Web3Auth infrastructure](/infrastructure/key-management/) you'll notice that to enable the non custodiality of Web3Auth, we
split the private key into multiple parts, ie. `shares`. These shares are a part of the off chain multisig, where multiple shares are stored in
different places and can be used to reconstruct the private key dynamically in the user's frontend application. For a glance at the structure of the
shares, these are the following:

1. **`ShareA` is managed by a login service via node operators**: This share is further split amongst a network of nodes and retrieved via
   conventional authentication flows.
2. **`ShareB` is stored on the user's device**: Implementation is device and system specific. For example, on mobile devices, the share could be
   stored in device storage secured via biometrics.
3. **`ShareC` is a recovery share**: An extra share to be kept by the user, possibly kept on a separate device, downloaded or based on user input with
   enough entropy (eg. password, security questions, hardware device etc.).

Similar to existing 2FA systems, a user needs to prove ownership of at least 2 out of 3 (2/3) shares, in order to retrieve his private key. This
initial setup provides several benefits.

## The User Experience in Mobile Platforms

The user experience on mobile platforms is very different from the web platforms. This is because the user has to be redirected to a browser where
they can login using their socials and then back to the app once they have been successfully authenticated. This user experience shifts the context
between two applications, whereas, in web platforms, the context remains within the browser only.

For the seamless login flow, we need to reconstruct Shares A, and B. Share A is managed by the login service and is provided on successful
authentication. Whereas in web platforms, Share B is stored in the browser context. We can still store it in the browser context for mobile devices,
but this has a few risks, like users accidentally deleting browser data. This is a bigger problem in mobile devices since the user doesn't realize
that the browser is being used to login within the app, and clearing the browser data can cause their logins to fail. Hence, to tackle this issue,
Web3Auth issues a dApp Share, i.e., a backup share that can be stored by the app developer directly within their application and used to reconstruct
the private key after successful login by the user.

## The dApp Share

Once a user logs in, their details are returned as a response to the mobile application. The same response can be retrieved in web applications by
utilizing the `getUserInfo()` function. Here's what the login response looks like for various platforms.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="web"
  values={[
    { label: "Web", value: "web" },
    { label: "Android", value: "android" },
    { label: "iOS", value: "ios" },
    { label: "React Native", value: "react-native" },
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter" },
  ]}

In all of the responses, there is a field called dappShare, which is a 24-word seed phrase that can be used to reconstruct the private key. These
dappShares supplement Share A and makeup half of the private key. The application can securely store the dApp share in its local storage. Users can
use their social media accounts to obtain one share when logging in. The application provides the dApp Share, eliminating the need to store the share
in the browser context and enabling users to log in smoothly. This is accomplished by passing the stored dApp share value in the login function (for
Mobile SDKs) or the openlogin adapter configuration (for Web SDK).

:::note

It's important to understand that `dappShare` is exclusively for `custom verifiers` and can't be used with standard web3auth verifiers. Moreover,
**only users who have `enabled MFA` can access it**. To use dApp Share, you need to use the custom authentication feature of Web3Auth. This guarantees
that an application can only access the share corresponding to a user's private key.
