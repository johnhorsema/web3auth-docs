You can use the Web3Auth [Single Factor Auth iOS SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/single-factor-auth-swift) as a library for your iOS app to
authenticate users through Web3Auth. The SDK is written in Swift and allows for native use of the One Key flow, which starts with just one share of
the key. This means that users can authenticate without redirection in a single key pair flow.

Using the Web3Auth SFA iOS SDK, you can authenticate users and reconstruct their private keys quickly and easily. Additionally, you can use the
Web3Auth Plug and Play iOS SDK to redirect users to a Web3Auth-hosted screen (`http://app.openlogin.com`), which is suitable for most use cases.
However, if you want more control over the UI and UX of the authentication process, you can customize the authentication flow to avoid redirection.
This is possible with the new Web3Auth SFA iOS SDK, which allows you to use Web3Auth SFA iOS and prevent redirection to openlogin hosted screens.

#### This Documentation is based on `2.0.3` SDK Version.
