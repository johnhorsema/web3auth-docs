Web3Auth provides a [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-flutter-sdk) written in Dart. It is a client-side library you can use with your
Flutter app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns a private key generated in a non-custodial way on successful user authentication. This
authentication is achieved by using any of the supported social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

#### This Documentation is based on `2.0.3` SDK Version.
