## Swift Package Manager

#### Add the Web3Auth PnP iOS SDK to your project

1. In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to **File > Add Packages**.

1. When prompted, add the tKey iOS SDK repository:

   ```sh
   https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk
   ```

   From the `Dependency Rule` dropdown, select `Exact Version` and enter `6.0.1` as the version.

1. When finished, Xcode will automatically begin resolving and downloading your dependencies in the background.

## Cocoapods

```sh
pod 'Web3Auth', '~> 6.0.1'
```

## Configuration

In order to use Web3Auth you need to provide your Web3Auth `ClientId` and which `Network` to run it.

- Go to [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io), create or open an existing Web3Auth project and copy your Client ID, which is
  the `ClientId`.
- Whitelist `(bundleId)://auth` in the developer dashboard. This step is mandatory for the redirect to work.
