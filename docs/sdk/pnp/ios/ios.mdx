For using Web3Auth in natively in iOS, Web3Auth provides an [iOS SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-swift-sdk), written in Swift. The Web3Auth
iOS SDK is a client-side library you can use with your iOS app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It returns a private key generated in a non
custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of the social logins Web3Auth provides or
using a custom authentication flow of your choice.

#### This Documentation is based on `6.0.1` SDK Version.
