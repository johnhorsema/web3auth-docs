## Selecting your Workflow

In React Native, you have the choice to use one of the following workflows:

### Expo Managed Workflow

Your Expo app is built on your Expo's cloud, so you don't have control over the native modules used in the app. Developers build managed workflow apps
using `expo-cli` on their computer and a development client on their mobile devices. Managed workflows apps typically use one or more Expo services,
such as push notifications, build, and updates.

:::warning Note

The React Native PnP SDK V4 is not compatible with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds. Please refer to the
troubleshooting section for more on this. Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code based on the version of expo a project has installed,
before running `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

:::

### Bare React Native Workflow

Your Bare React Native app is entirely built on your own machine. In this workflow the developer has complete control, along with the complexity that
comes with that. Configuration with `app.json` / `app.config.js` is mostly not supported in this context; instead, you will need to configure each native
project directly with Swift/Kotlin native modules. Check out the [troubleshooting section](/docs/sdk/pnp/react-native/install#troubleshooting) for fixing common issues.

:::tip

You can read more about different workflows in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/).

:::

## Installation

#### [`@web3auth/react-native-sdk`](https://github.com/web3auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk)

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

### Adding a Web Browser Module

We will also require a `WebBrowser` implementation to allow our JS-based SDK to interact with the native APIs, and there are different extra
installation steps depending on whether you are using the bare workflow or managed workflow.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="bare"
  values={[
    { label: "Expo Managed Workflow", value: "expo" },
    { label: "Bare React Native Workflow", value: "bare" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="expo">

#### Expo Web Browser

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow), you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation.

```shell
expo install expo-web-browser
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bare">

#### React Native Web Browser

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `WebBrowser` implementation made by us.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @toruslabs/react-native-web-browser
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Adding a `Storage` Module

Now with v4, we need to pass a `Storage` parameter to the SDK, which will be used for session management without storing the private keys of the user
in the device.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="bare"
  values={[
    { label: "Expo Managed Workflow", value: "expo" },
    { label: "Bare React Native Workflow", value: "bare" },
  ]}
>

<TabItem value="expo">

#### Expo Secure Store

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow), you have to install the `expo-secure-store` package as a `Storage`
implementation.

```shell
expo install expo-secure-store
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bare">

#### React Native Encrypted Storage

When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a `Storage` implementation provided by react-native.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save react-native-encrypted-storage
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

After you have installed the files needed for your workflow, you'll have to configure the SDK with some additional steps to be able to use the SDK
properly.

### Expo Managed Workflow

- Adding URL scheme to `app.json`

To allow the Expo based SDK to work with exported Expo Android apps, you need to add the designated scheme into `app.json`

```json title="app.json"
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "web3authexpoexample" // replace with your own scheme
  }
}
```

- For constructing your `redirectUrl`, you'll need to use the `expo-linking`, which will help you generate a `redirectUrl` for your app. Make sure you
  register that URL in the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

```js title="App.js"
import Constants, { AppOwnership } from "expo-constants";
import * as Linking from "expo-linking";

const resolvedRedirectUrl =
  Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Expo || Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Guest
    ? Linking.createURL("web3auth", {})
    : Linking.createURL("web3auth", { scheme: scheme });
```

:::tip

You may refer to [these example apps](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+React+Native+SDK) and try it out yourself.

:::

### Bare React Native Workflow

For the bare workflow, you need to perform additional installation steps, alongside specific configuration for Android and iOS separately.

#### Android

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `build.gradle` is 31 or more.

```gradle title="android/build.gradle"
buildToolsVersion = "31.0.0"
minSdkVersion = 21
# highlight-next-line
compileSdkVersion = 31
# highlight-next-line
targetSdkVersion = 31
```

- Add the intent filter with `scheme` defined in your `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
  # replace with your own scheme
  # highlight-next-line
  <data android:scheme="web3authrnexample" />
</intent-filter>
```

- SDK version 31 requires you to explicitly define `android:exported="true"` in `AndroidManifest.xml`, check whether it is correctly present or not.

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<activity
  android:name=".MainActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name"
  android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|uiMode"
  android:launchMode="singleTask"
  android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"
# highlight-next-line
  android:exported="true">
```

- Your `redirectUrl` is your defined scheme following some identifier or your choice. For example, if your scheme is `web3authrnexample`, you can
  define your `redirectUrl` as `web3authrnexample://openlogin`. Make sure you register this `redirectUrl` in the
  [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

```js title="App.js"
const scheme = "web3authrnexample"; // Or your desired app redirection scheme
const resolvedRedirectUrl = `${scheme}://openlogin`;
```

#### iOS

- Make sure that the minimum SDK compile version in `Podfile` is 14 or more.

```Podfile title="ios/Podfile"
platform :ios, '14'
```

- Install the Cocoa Pods within your project directory.

```shell
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

- In iOS, you don't need to add `redirectUrl` as a iOS Custom URL Scheme, however, you may can add it to your `Info.plist`, but it is not required.
  Make sure your `redirectUrl` is registered in the [Web3Auth Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io).

:::tip

You may refer to **[these example apps](/examples?product=Plug+and+Play&sdk=Plug+and+Play+React+Native+SDK)** and try it out yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### Bundler Polyfilling

These libraries use many packages that are not present in the React Native environment. Hence, to get around that, you need to manually polyfill them.

- Install the missing modules:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save empty-module readable-stream crypto-browserify react-native-get-random-values buffer process
```

- Update your `metro.config.js` as per the polyfilled modules:

:::info

You will have to create `metro.config.js` for Expo Managed Workflow, as it is not present by default. Also note that the React Native PnP SDK is not
compatible with "Expo Go" app. It is compatible only with Custom Dev Client and EAS builds. Please run `npx expo prebuild` to generate native code
based on the version of expo a project has installed, before running `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

:::

#### `metro.config.js` for expo managed workflow

```js title="metro.config.js"
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
  } = await getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

  const defaultSourceExts = [...sourceExts, "svg", "mjs", "cjs"];

  return {
    resolver: {
      extraNodeModules: {
        assert: require.resolve("empty-module"), // assert can be polyfilled here if needed
        http: require.resolve("empty-module"), // stream-http can be polyfilled here if needed
        https: require.resolve("empty-module"), // https-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        os: require.resolve("empty-module"), // os-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        url: require.resolve("empty-module"), // url can be polyfilled here if needed
        zlib: require.resolve("empty-module"), // browserify-zlib can be polyfilled here if needed
        path: require.resolve("empty-module"),
        crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
        stream: require.resolve("readable-stream"),
      },

      assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== "svg"),

      sourceExts: process.env.TEST_REACT_NATIVE ? ["e2e.js"].concat(defaultSourceExts) : defaultSourceExts,
    },
    transformer: {
      getTransformOptions: async () => ({
        transform: {
          experimentalImportSupport: false,
          inlineRequires: true,
        },
      }),
    },
  };
})();
```

#### `metro.config.js` for bare workflow

```js title="metro.config.js"
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("metro-config");

module.exports = (async () => {
  const {
    resolver: { sourceExts, assetExts },
  } = await getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

  const defaultSourceExts = [...sourceExts, "svg", "mjs", "cjs"];

  return {
    resolver: {
      extraNodeModules: {
        assert: require.resolve("empty-module"), // assert can be polyfilled here if needed
        http: require.resolve("empty-module"), // stream-http can be polyfilled here if needed
        https: require.resolve("empty-module"), // https-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        os: require.resolve("empty-module"), // os-browserify can be polyfilled here if needed
        url: require.resolve("empty-module"), // url can be polyfilled here if needed
        zlib: require.resolve("empty-module"), // browserify-zlib can be polyfilled here if needed
        path: require.resolve("empty-module"),
        crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
        stream: require.resolve("readable-stream"),
      },

      assetExts: assetExts.filter((ext) => ext !== "svg"),

      sourceExts: process.env.TEST_REACT_NATIVE ? ["e2e.js"].concat(defaultSourceExts) : defaultSourceExts,
    },
    transformer: {
      getTransformOptions: async () => ({
        transform: {
          experimentalImportSupport: false,
          inlineRequires: true,
        },
      }),
    },
  };
})();
```

### Fixing dependency issues

Add `globals.js` to your project root directory and add the following code to it.

```js title="globals.js"
global.Buffer = require("buffer").Buffer;

// Needed so that 'stream-http' chooses the right default protocol.
global.location = {
  protocol: "file:",
};

global.process.version = "v16.0.0";
if (!global.process.version) {
  global.process = require("process");
  console.log({ process: global.process });
}

process.browser = true;
```

Then, import the dependencies to `index.js` of your project.

```js title="index.js"
import { AppRegistry } from "react-native";
import "./globals";
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import App from "./App";
import { name as appName } from "./app.json";
AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```
