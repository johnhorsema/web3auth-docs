For using Web3Auth in React Native, Web3Auth provides an [React Native SDK](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-react-native-sdk), written in
TypeScript. The Web3Auth React Native SDK is a client-side library you can use with your React Native app to authenticate users using Web3Auth. It
returns a private key generated in a non custodial way on successful authentication of the user. This authentication can be achieved by using any of
the social logins Web3Auth provides or using a custom authentication flow of your choice.
