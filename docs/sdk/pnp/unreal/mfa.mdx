The Multi Factor Authentication feature refers to the ability of the user to create a backup share (recovery phrase). This helps them login into a new
device and also to recover their account if they lose their original device.

You can set the mfaLevel within the `loginParams` to customize when mfa screen should be shown to user. It currently accepts 4 values:

- **`default`** - Setting the mfaLevel to default will present the MFA screen to user on every third login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.DEFAULT`
- **`optional`** - Setting mfaLevel to optional will present the MFA screen to user on every login but user will have the option to skip it.
  `mfaLevel = MFALevel.OPTIONAL`
- **`mandatory`** - Setting mfaLevel to mandatory will make it mandatory for user to setup MFA after login. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.MANDATORY`
- **`none`** - Setting mfaLevel to none will skip the mfa setup screen totally. `mfaLevel = MFALevel.NONE`

## Arguments
