### 1. Add Web3Auth

Add `web3auth_flutter` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```bash
dependencies:
  web3auth_flutter: ^2.0.3
```

or

```bash
flutter pub add web3auth_flutter
```

### 2. Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### 3. Create Web3Auth Instance

Construct the `Web3Auth` instance with:

```dart
await Web3AuthFlutter.init(Web3AuthOptions(
    clientId: "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID",
    network: Network.testnet,
    redirectUrl: redirectUrl
));
```

### 4. Login your User

Once you're done initialising, just create a button that triggers the login for the user on their request. Logging in is as easy as:

```dart
final Web3AuthResponse response = await Web3AuthFlutter.login(
  LoginParams(loginProvider: Provider.google)
);
```
