### 1. Install Web3Auth

Install Web3Auth's React Native package in your React Native project. When using our SDK with a bare workflow React Native app, you have to install a

const scheme = "web3authrnexample"; // Or your desired app redirection scheme
const resolvedRedirectUrl = `${scheme}://openlogin`;

const clientId = "YOUR_WEB3AUTH_CLIENT_ID";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, EncryptedStorage, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});

```js
await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
