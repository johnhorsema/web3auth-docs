### 1. Install Web3Auth

Install Web3Auth's React Native package in your React Native project.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @web3auth/react-native-sdk
```

When using our SDK with a Expo-based React Native app (aka managed workflow), you have to install the `expo-web-browser` package as a `WebBrowser`
implementation. You also need to install `expo-secure-store` to store the user's session.

```bash
expo install expo-web-browser expo-secure-store
```

### 2. Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard

Visit the [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io) and create a new project. Use the Client ID of the project to start your integration.

### 3. Create Web3Auth Instance

Construct the `Web3Auth` instance with:

```js
import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser";
import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";
import Web3Auth, { LOGIN_PROVIDER, OPENLOGIN_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/react-native-sdk";

const resolvedRedirectUrl =
  Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Expo || Constants.appOwnership == AppOwnership.Guest
    ? Linking.createURL("web3auth", {})
    : Linking.createURL("web3auth", { scheme: scheme });

const clientId = "YOUR WEB3AUTH CLIENT ID";

const web3auth = new Web3Auth(WebBrowser, SecureStore, {
  clientId,
  network: OPENLOGIN_NETWORK.TESTNET, // or other networks
});
```

### 4. Login your User

Once you're done initialising, just create a button that triggers the login for the user on their request. Logging in is as easy as:

Please note that the v4 react-native-sdk has some breaking changes. For instance, `web3auth.login` is a void method, unlike the older versions of the
SDK. Please refer to the [migration guide](/docs/sdk/pnp/react-native/migration-guide-to-v4) for more

```js
await web3auth.login({
  loginProvider: LoginProvider.GOOGLE,
  redirectUrl: resolvedRedirectUrl,
});
```
