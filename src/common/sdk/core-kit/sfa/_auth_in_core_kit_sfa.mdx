Let's look at the general authentication flow at Web3Auth.

When a user logs in with Web3Auth, a user's account can be in two states:

- **Account Without MFA**: When the User logs in with only social login and key is secured by Web3Auth network.
- **Account With MFA**: When the User enables MFA by adding other shares like password, backup share, device share, etc., to their existing account.

:::warning warning

This SDK only works for users who have **not enabled MFA**.

For MFA enabled users, you'll see `Error("User has already enabled mfa, please use the Web3Auth PnP Web or Mobile SDKs for login with mfa");`

### Without Openlogin Redirection Flow

By default, to reconstruct key in both states, Web3Auth SDKs redirects the user to `http://app.openlogin.com`. Where all the computation to
reconstruct the key is done. The advantage of this approach is that it makes it easy for applications to integrate web3auth SDK without having to
worry about the key reconstruction process. But sometimes, applications want to reconstruct the key in their application context, where the
authentication flow described can be used with this SDK.

## Create `Custom Auth` Verifier

Once you click on the `Create Verifier` button on Web3Auth Dashboard, you'll see a toggle similar to these, where you can create a custom verifier for
your use case.
